Simulations in Data Science- Applications and Implications 

Ever since my datascience 1 course covered the topic of simulations in data I’ve been thinking about the implications and applications of this tool.  We were taught to use simulations as a means of control, or verification of the validity of a dataset. The way we were taught to do so was through using a code block such as:
```{r}
library(mdsr)
library(tidyr)

uniform <- data.frame(u = runif(1000))
ggplot(uniform, aes(x = u)) +
geom_histogram()
```
Which prints a histogram of a random dataframe of 1000 values. Taking a step deeper, we looked at restaurants and sanitation grades across New York City using the Violations package in R. Dr. Sweeney’s theory was that restaurants close to the cutoff between A and B, for example, would be more likely to receive A’s as a result of some underlying confound. 

While you would expect there to be a normal distribution of scores across the grades for restaurant violations, there seems to be a cluster slightly above the benchmarks for grades (i.e. restaurants with 7 violations receive an A, while those with 8 or more receive a B). We looked at what a normal distribution of scores would look like through using simulations, and then comparing the actual values to the “expected” or simulated in the following code block:
```{r}
#setup to isolate the scores
minval <- 7
maxval <- 19
JustScores <- Violations %>%
filter(score >= minval & score <= maxval)%>%
select(dba, score) %>%
unique()
#creating the simulation
scores <- tally(~score, data = JustScores)
RandomFlip <- do(1000) * rflip(scores["13"] + scores["14"])
#plotting the simulated data vs actual
g <- ggplot(data = RandomFlip, aes(x = heads)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
xlim(c(2100, NA)) +
geom_vline(xintercept = scores["14"], col = 'red', size = 2) +
annotate("text", x = 2137, y = 45, label = 'observed', hjust = 'left') +
xlab("Number of restaurants with scores of 14 (if equal probability)")
g
```
